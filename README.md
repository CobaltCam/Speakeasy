# CobaltDM
Cobalt DM is intended to be an automation tool to help players and Dungeon Masters of 5th edition dungeons and dragons who use discord as their primary platform for communication automate randomized choices. Initially this
program will only contain a random name generator supporting the following races: 

-Dragonborn

-Dwarf

-Elf

-Gnome

-Half-orc

-Halfling

-Teifling

-and a variety of Human ethnicities

You may also choose to generate a name for a male, female, or non-binary character. 
 

# Future Plans

Down the road I intend to add more features to this program, but as this is my first large scale coding project it will take some time. Currently my planned features include:

-Random encounter generator based on party level

-Random loot generator based on party level

Hope you enjoy!
